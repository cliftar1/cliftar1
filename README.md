Hello,

My Github username is Cliftar1, but I have been known for many years as Dragonclaw103 in minecraft and youtube.
Here is my Youtube channel.  Its short and sweet.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvEQJjTjdqa2idqM8ypPCSA

I’m currently working on videos for AdvancedRegionMarket

I’m currently learning how to work Github

I’m looking for help with creating a plugin to allow Minecraft players to purchase schematics as a one time purchase, and place on a region they own, using something like Constructor to build the schematic.

You can reach me on Discord https://discord.gg/BWMCmFM3ud

I also love working with BEST Robotics Competitions.
